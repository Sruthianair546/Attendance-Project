**Project Overview: Attendance Marking System**

The Attendance Marking System is a face recognition-based application designed to automate attendance tracking using computer vision. The system captures images of students, detects faces using Haar cascade classifiers, and processes the images for recognition. Once trained, the system can identify students and mark their attendance automatically.

**Key Features:**

Image Capture: Users can capture student images, which are stored in a dataset for training.

Face Detection: Uses OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time.

Model Training: Processes captured images to create a face recognition model.

Attendance Automation: Recognized faces can be used to mark attendance efficiently.

**Technology Stack:**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow

Frameworks: OpenCV Face Recognition Module

**Future Enhancements:**

Implementing real-time video-based attendance tracking.

Integrating a database for storing attendance records.

This project provides an efficient and modern solution for automating attendance tracking using face recognition technology.
